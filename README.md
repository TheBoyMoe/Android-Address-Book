Android Content Provider Demo App
=================================

Inspired by the Address Book Android App in Paul Deitel's 'Android 6 for Programmers, 3rd edn(http://www.deitel.com/Books/Android/AndroidforProgrammersAnAppDrivenApproach3/tabid/3671/Default.aspx). 
The app allows the user to save contacts to a simple address book.
You can add, edit and delete contact details.

The app is a learning exercise in the implementation of the following:
- SQLite database and Content Providers
